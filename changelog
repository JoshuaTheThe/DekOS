Major bug fix / Minor update,

i have removed the TSS, and made a much better software solution to switching, that ACTUALLY WORKS.
i have also added information on kernel crashes, involving a symbol table.

i have added and rearranged ~10 interrupt calls.
including the adding of IPC, process management, and other useful tasks. (untested).

the shell also yields to the program, until ESCAPE is pressed, or until the program exits.

NOTE:
        the symbol generation, is a bit weird and buggy, so if it fails to build, just try again.

there are also unmentioned changes.
